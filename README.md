# TES-Alchemy-App 
An app built using ReactNative to function as a reference for the Alchemy system in TES V:Skyrim by Bethesda. It is a remake of the older, native Android version of the app from [this repository](https://github.com/Patypus/TES-Alchemy-App).

I've made it for my own use and as an excuse for making something using React Native. As such it is designed and tested for Android as I don't have an iOS device. I plan to come back and add this support at a later point, but for now use at your own risk.
